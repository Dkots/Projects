In this project I tried to categorize a set of proteins in six teams according with geometrical and biological features. For geometrical features, I used Gaussian and Mean curvature
The proteins are 3d geometrical models which consist of mesh point and triangles. Each of these points has three values which represent the biological attributes. 
With aforementioned features, I had to build a superrvized model, specifically a dissimilarity matrix, trained with 369 proteins and 6 labels and tested with 41 proteins.
